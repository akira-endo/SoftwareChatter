## Additional Resources
* One of the things that came up in our first session and later on in the social
  was the need for better guidance on "good practice" for analysis workflows. 
  I've started some [workflow notes](notes/analysis_workflows.md) that will
  hopefully point people in the right direction.  Hopefully we can build on
  these going forward.
