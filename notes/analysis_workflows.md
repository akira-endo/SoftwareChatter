# Analysis Workflows

## Getting started

A great place to start is the paper 
["Good enough practices in scientific computing"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).
This aims to convey a set of good practices that researches should aim for with
their work.  Don't worry if it initially seems overwhelming (everyone feels the
same).  but the earlier you can adopt a methodical and structured approach to
your analysis the easier it will be in the long run for both you and your
collaborators.

Finding courses that teach this in a language agnostic way can be a little hard.
One prominent one in the R sphere is the [stat 545 course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/)
at the University of British Columbia.  This focusses on the structure and 
implementation of data analysis not the analysis itself.  It builds upon the
[original course](https://stat545.com/) by Jenny Bryan which has been adopted by the education side of
RStudio.  Both the original and the current course
will hopefully be of use, particularly if you are using R.

One of the things I was initially most scared of was version control. It seemed
something solely for software developers and I didn't know where to start.
Fortunately, it's not as scary as it sounds and there are some great resources
out there for beginners.  The most accessible is
[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/).  Again this is
an R focussed resource however the [Git fundamentals](https://happygitwithr.com/git-intro.html)
will hopefully be of use to all.
